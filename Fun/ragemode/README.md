# Ragemode
Ragemode is a basic One In The Chamber (OIC) liek gamemode, inspired by [Freggy's](https://github.com/freggy) [version for LuaLink V1](https://github.com/freggy/ragemode-lua)

# Notes
The default spawn points in this gamemode assume that you are using the map hijacked. This map can be found in [Freggy's original repository](https://github.com/freggy/ragemode-lua)
